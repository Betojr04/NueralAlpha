# NueralAlpha
Neural Alpha is an autonomous trade intelligence engine. Give it a theme, stock, or market signal, and it generates a trading idea by ingesting news, earnings calls, sentiment feeds, and technical patterns. The AI builds a thesis, selects a strategy (e.g. options, long/short, sector spread), and shows a backtested simulation.
